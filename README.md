# Eldoria Chronicles

Eldoria Chronicles is a game built with **Godot 4**, featuring a mage, collecting golden coins in a world with moving platforms, while evading slimes, and trenches.

## 🎮 Controls

Eldoria Chronicles supports both **controller** and **keyboard + mouse** input. I tested the game on MacOS with an XboX controller connected via Bluetooth.

### Keyboard + Mouse

- **Move**: `WASD`
- **Attack**: `Left Mouse Button`
- **Jump**: `Spacebar`

### Controller

- **Move**: `Left Stick`
- **Attack**: `Right Trigger`
- **Jump**: `A Button`

## 🚀 Installation

Download the game from the [latest release](https://github.com/kireiiiiiiii/eldoria-chronicles/releases/latest).

### 🖥️ Windows Installation

1. Download the `eldoria-chronicles-version-windows.zip` file.
2. Extract the contents anywhere on your PC.
3. Run `EldoriaChronicles.exe` to start playing.

### 🍏 macOS Installation

1. Download the `eldoria-chronicles-version-mac.dmg` file.
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag `Eldoria Chronicles.app` into the **Applications** folder.
3. Launch the game from **Applications**.

## ⚙️ DMG Creation Script (For macOS Developers)

If you're working on packaging Eldoria Chronicles for macOS, you can use the included **DMG Creation Script**, to create a pretty DMG installer with a proper window size and background. I made this script because the DMG files exported from Godot 4 are not pretty and user-friendly. You can find all the files for this process in the [.gdignore](https://github.com/kireiiiiiiii/eldoria-chronicles/tree/main/.gdignore) directory, as I don't want them to be imported by Godot.

### Default script behaviour

The script has a list of constants on the top, determining the input an output, resource and other paths. All of the following paths are relative the the `.gdignore` directory. These are the default values:

```bash

APP_NAME="Eldoria Chronicles"                   # Application name (without extension)
DMG_NAME="eldoria-chronicles-raw.dmg"           # Name of the existing Godot DMG (inside 'source' dir)
NEW_DMG_NAME="eldoria-chronicles-1.0.0-mac.dmg" # Name of the DMG that will be created (inside 'build' dir)
BACKGROUND_IMG="dmg-background.png"             # Background image for the new DMG (inside 'source' dir)
SOURCE_DIR="source"                             # Directory containing the original DMG
OUTPUT_DIR="build"                              # Output directory for the final DMG
TEMP_DIR="temp"                                 # Temporary directory for extracted app (will be deleted)
MOUNT_POINT="/Volumes/$APP_NAME"                # Mount point for the DMG (usually unchanged)

```

### 📜 How the Script Works

This script:

1. Mounts an existing `.dmg` file generated by Godot.
2. Extracts the `.app` file to a temporary directory.
3. Uses `create-dmg` to create a **custom `.dmg`** with a new background and proper layout.

### ▶️ Running the Script

```sh
chmod +x build-dmg.sh   # Make the script executable
./build-dmg.sh          # Run the script
```

This will generate a `.dmg` file in the `build/` directory.

## 📌 Development Goals
